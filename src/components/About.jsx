          <p>
            I’m <span className="font-semibold">Liann C. Gonzales</span>, an Information Technology student with a strong
            interest in <span className="font-semibold">software development</span> and
            <span className="font-semibold"> system integration</span>. I enjoy learning new technologies, solving
            problems through coding, and building projects that challenge me to grow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alongside tech, I’m also a <span className="font-semibold">self-taught graphic designer</span>. I
            specialize in <span className="font-semibold">logo design, branding, and illustrations</span>, and I’m
            passionate about combining creativity with functionality to create impactful designs.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to become a well-rounded IT professional who can merge
            <span className="font-semibold"> technical expertise</span> with
            <span className="font-semibold"> creative design thinking</span> to develop solutions that are both
            effective and visually engaging.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of academics and design, I enjoy <span className="font-semibold">sports and digital arts</span>,
            which help me stay balanced and inspired in both work and life.
